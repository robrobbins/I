This is a minified version of i.js to use. Don't confuse this minified files
produced by the 'demaximize' option in 'depwriter.rb'. Those files will be placed
alongside your development files so that the paths are correct. 

This file directory is simply a way to seperate the minified version of i.js
from the full source. Unless you want to dubug through i.js or hack on it just
use the minified version as the example does.
