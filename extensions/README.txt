These files are an example of how you might want to extend i.js with
some stuff of your own. I typically use these 3 on large projects, note 
however that they are not necessary for i.js to work and aren't included
by default

Note that the 'class.js' file should be moved to the js/vendors directory
if you want to use it as I don't specify any 'define()' or 'require()'
statements in it.
